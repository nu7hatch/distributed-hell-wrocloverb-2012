            Unix hackers understand this since long time ago. First
            they split up programs into subprograms, then they split
            big apps into libraries and built small and reusable tools
            based on those libraries...

            You know there's funny story about it actually...
            On early beginnings of unix development, Dennis Ritchie said
            to all the hackers around, that function calls in C are super
            cheap, so it's possible to split the spaghetti code into
            subprograms... After a while more curious guys discovered
            that he lied, and function call were actually very slow...
            But, it was too late, most of the code was written that way,
            was slower, but super easy to maintain...

            it was simple, rapid to work with, explicit and fun... It just went
            to wrong direction.

            Web applications are very similar to the operating systems. They do
            many small things like managing users, posting articles, commenting things,
            talk with others and so on...

            Currently, most of the Web apps, especially Rails apps, are big,
            containing lot of unrelated model entities, http responses in
            different formats, with some javascript layer around. That's not the

            serves bunch of things using small sinatra services on JRuby.

            Rails was, and maybe still at some point is fast at development
            speed. That's why it is preffered by many startup comanies.
